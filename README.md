# SSD300 and Object detection

<p align="justify">
<strong>SSD300 (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)</strong>
 is a deep learning model designed for object detection tasks. It uses a single feed-forward convolutional network to predict object classes and bounding box locations directly from an input image, without needing a separate region proposal stage. The "300" in SSD300 refers to the input image size of 300x300 pixels, making it faster and more efficient while maintaining high accuracy. SSD300 is known for its balance between speed and performance, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Object detection
<p align="justify">
<strong>Object detection</strong> is a computer vision technique in machine learning that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. Unlike image classification, which assigns a label to an entire image, object detection not only classifies objects but also draws bounding boxes around them to specify their exact locations. This task is crucial for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and image analysis, where understanding the context and position of objects is essential.
